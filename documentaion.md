# UCI Mobile App Redesign

## Device Chosen
UCI German Mobile App is the "device" of choice. United Cinemas International is a international film group, in this project I specifaclly am targetting the German version of the app.

## Evidence of Design Flaw

## Why this is a design flaw

## Illustrating the Flaw

A user wants to purchase a ticket for Zootopia 2. They go to select the movie and time at which they would like to watch it. They are just using the app as a guest, therefore they select the guest option. The screen moves down and you see the seat selection screen and try to press on it, until they realise they have to enter an email before they could continue. Once they do the seat selection screen is still there but additionally there is the ticket type selection. Which they must first enter before selecting the seat. The user is now frustrated that it keeps showing them section that they are not allowed to select. Once at the checkout screen, the user wants to change the seat. The only option to go back is by swiping right over the whole screen. THis throws them all the way back to the home screen. Forcing them to restart the whole process. 

Home screen > Movie > Time > Login Screen + Seat Selection > Ticket type + Seat Selection > Seat Selection > Checkout screen > (go back to Seat Selection) > Home Screen

User want to see new movies coming soon but they need to scroll past the cluttered home screen sections
